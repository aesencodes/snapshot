# Web App Social Media with Mobile First View (Under Development)

This is a web application for social media with a mobile-first view. It is built using ReactJS, TypeScript, Appwrite, and React Query.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where UI updates happen frequently.
- **TypeScript**: A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language.
- **Appwrite**: An open-source backend server that helps developers build web and mobile applications faster using REST and WebSocket APIs.
- **React Query**: A data-fetching and state management library for React applications.
